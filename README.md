# wal startpage
forked from u/nytly and improved w/ pywal

u/nytly original: https://notabug.org/nytly/home

pywal github: https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal

change your links and path to your username after installing pywal, this will not work if you don't have pywal installed

here is a couple of examples on how my background image and css colors changed dynamically with pywal
